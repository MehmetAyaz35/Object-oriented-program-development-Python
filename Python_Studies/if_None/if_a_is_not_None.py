if a is not None:
    print("a has a value other than None")
else:
    print("a is explicitly set to None")


# if a is not None:
# This explicitly checks if the value of A is not None. It does not rely on the truthiness or falsiness of A. This is useful when you want to distinguish between a variable being explicitly set to None and having some other value.
